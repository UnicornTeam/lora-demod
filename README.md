# lora-demod

This is a simple Matlab/Octave script which can demodulate I/Q samples into bits. 

You could try the following commands to the given sample file:
lora_sig_demod('WaterMeter_NID1_PL6_BW125_SF11.cs8',70,3);
lora_sig_demod('SelfGen_EnableCRC_PL6_BW125_CR48_SF11_SW12_DataHh.cs8',20,3);
lora_sig_demod('SelfGen_PL6_BW125_CR48_SF11_SW12_DataHello.cs8',20,3);

- WaterMeter_NID1_PL6_BW125_SF11.cs8

This is the file of captured water meter signal.

- SelfGen_EnableCRC_PL6_BW125_CR48_SF11_SW12_DataHh.cs8
- SelfGen_PL6_BW125_CR48_SF11_SW12_DataHello.cs8

These two files are the captured signal generated by the same module as the water meter, but with self-setting parameters.
